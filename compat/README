This directory contains sources required for replacing functions as
determined by AC_REPLACE_FUNCS in the configure script. This directory is
chosen by AC_CONFIG_LIBOBJ_DIR([compat]) in the configure script. If you
are missing the necessary sources for all the LIBOBJs required by all the
invocations of AC_REPLACE_FUNCS, try looking in gnulib:
http://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/
(autotools is a GNU project after all, so AC_REPLACE_FUNCS assumes that
you have GNU sources available to you)
